#### Conclusion-Flight category

- From the analysis, it's clear that private planes have a high injury count as compared to the commercial planes.  


- From our analysis, private planes reported the highest numbers of injuries overally with 21,523 fatal,12,387 serious and 15,277 minor. 
Interpratation-private plates exprinece significant more fatalities and injuries maybe due to their size, less rigorous maintenance and maybe inexperienced pilots.

- Unknown category-23,062 fatal injuries, and also has the highest fatal count.
Interpration: Since the data has alot of unclassifies and unreported flights, there might be incomplere data to conclusively interptrate this.

- Commercial categories
From the analysis, they have reported the lowest number of injuries with 5616 fatal,3036 serious and 3776 minor.

- Interpratation- Commercial flights have the best safety records due to stict safety regulations, experienced crews and advanced aircraft technologies.

- Therefore based on this, private aircrafts show most injuies across all categories, making them a riskkier for business operations. Comercial aircrafts remain the safest option wuth lowest fatalities and injuries. It will be prudent to advise the client to base his enterprise more on commercial planes than private planes. Commercial planes are the better safer option and also reliable.

  #### Conclusion-Make
- From the analysis, the top 10 aircrafts with the highest number of falaties are cessna, boeing, piper , beech etc have the highest number of fatalities. If we fully  depended on this data to advise the client, then we would recommend other crafts that do not have hifg record of fatalities for this business.

- Comparing the aircraft make, might help us decide on which model to purchase depending on how many accidents they are involved in.

- #### Conclusion-Engine Type Vs Damage
- Single engine aircraft(1 engine) have the highest proporton of substantial damage of about 75%.

- They are closely folowed by destroyes at 20% and only a small proprportion of minor or unknown damage.
Interpratation- Single engine planes are more vulnerable to substantial or complte damage in accidents.

- Two engines-Substantial dama(53%),Destroyed(25%), minor(10%) and unknown(11%).  Two engine are failrly better than single engines.

- Aircrafts with 6 and eight engines, their substantial damage is rare and small for 6-enginse and 67% for 8-engine.

Overal insights. 

- Substantial damage are common in all engine types.
Planes with (3-4) engines appear to reduce the proportion of severe outcomes maybe fue to better safety features.

- Single engine are the most risk in terms of damage.
